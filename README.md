Homeblocks
======

Build your homepage, block after block.

Homeblocks lets you build your own homepage with your favorite media: http links of course, but also audio streams, video streams and more.

See it in action on the cloud (OpenShift) and create your own profile there: http://www.homeblocks.net/

Build:
- Prepare TSD http://definitelytyped.org/tsd/
- Check https://basarat.gitbooks.io/typescript/content/docs/jsx/tsx.html => "tsd install react-global --save --resolve" (make sure you take react-global, not just react: there would be variable conflict otherway)
- Other to install the same way: express, body-parser, Q.
